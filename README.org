* Hedgehog problem
1. JDK 11
2. Maven 3.8.1
** Workflow
'input.txt' file is expected to exist in the folder of the exection file.
Input file must contain first row with numbers M and N separated with space and each of the next M rows must consists of N values of apples[i,j] separated with space.
Example:
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
The output file will contain  max amount of apples the hedgehog can collect on its way.
For sample above ouput file will contain number 29
** Algorithm
For calculation of the best path that hedgehog could take was used Breadth-first search algorithm
** Problems
Tried to do my best to make code more manageable and easily expandable but I'm not sure I did it properly
